  ### User Input

i Now I have working light/dark mode
I can fill in and save the json file, also, when the button “Save Daily Report” is clicked, the json file is created, I need to check if the data was indeed input into the sqlite db.

### Planner Response

To verify whether your form submission actually writes into the SQLite DB, I’ll first inspect your code to find the database file path and table schema used during “Save Daily Report.” Then I can propose a quick verification query and optionally run it in your venv.

I’m going to open `streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py` and `streamlit_entry.py` to locate the insert logic, DB path, and table names.

*Viewed [streamlit_entry.py](file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py) *

### Planner Response

I’ll run a quick, read-only Python check against your local SQLite file to verify that the most recent report and its child rows were inserted. This won’t modify anything. It will:

- Confirm the DB exists
- Print total rows per table
- Show the latest report (by report_id)
- Count child rows linked to that report

I’ll use your venv’s Python directly as per your guidelines.

# Findings

- __DB file__: `construction_management.db` in project root (used by [streamlit_entry.py](cci:7://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:0:0-0:0) `DB_FILE` and [streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py](cci:7://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py:0:0-0:0) `DB_FILE_DEFAULT`).
- __Schema insert points__: [save_report()](cci:1://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:327:0-379:20) calls [upsert_project()](cci:1://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:201:0-215:22), [insert_report()](cci:1://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:218:0-237:33), and [bulk_insert()](cci:1://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:240:0-324:9) in [streamlit_entry.py](cci:7://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:0:0-0:0).
- __Verification run (read-only)__:
  - DB exists: True
  - Row counts:
    - Projects: 1
    - DailyReports: 3
    - ManpowerLog: 7
    - EquipmentLog: 2
    - MaterialDeliveries: 2
    - WorkActivities: 7
  - Latest report: `report_id=3`, `project_id=1`, `report_date=2025-08-08`, `prepared_by=somethy...` (truncated in console wrap)
  - Child rows for `report_id=3`:
    - ManpowerLog: 2
    - EquipmentLog: 2
    - MaterialDeliveries: 2
    - WorkActivities: 2

Conclusion: your “Save Daily Report” writes to SQLite successfully. The latest report (ID 3) and its child rows are present.

# How to double-check in the app

- __Dashboard__: Run [streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py](cci:7://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py:0:0-0:0), pick your project and date. It reads the same DB and shows the saved data per tab.
- __Entry app__: The saving path is centralized; [save_report()](cci:1://file:///c:/coding/project_management_sqlite%202/streamlit_entry.py:327:0-379:20) commits everything in one transaction.

# Optional deeper checks

I can print the actual rows for `report_id=3` so you can visually confirm content (trades, equipment names, materials, activities). Want me to run a more detailed SELECT to show those rows?

If you prefer to run manually, use this SQL (read-only):

```sql
-- Latest report header
SELECT * FROM DailyReports ORDER BY report_id DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Replace 3 with your latest ID if different
SELECT * FROM ManpowerLog WHERE report_id=3;
SELECT * FROM EquipmentLog WHERE report_id=3;
SELECT * FROM MaterialDeliveries WHERE report_id=3;
SELECT * FROM WorkActivities WHERE report_id=3;
```

I can execute these via your venv and show the outputs here. Just say “show latest rows”.

# Summary

- Verified: data is in SQLite with consistent child rows linked to the latest `report_id`.  
- Ready to either display via the dashboard or print detailed rows on request.

### User Input

(project-management-sqlite-2) PS C:\coding\project_management_sqlite 2>      uv run streamlit run streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py --server.port 8502
2025-08-08 17:04:48.972 Port 8502 is already in use
(project-management-sqlite-2) PS C:\coding\project_management_sqlite 2>      uv run streamlit run streamlit_entry.py --server.port 8501
2025-08-08 17:05:35.931 Port 8501 is already in use
(project-management-sqlite-2) PS C:\coding\project_management_sqlite 2> 

I noticed that the 8502 on the left is the same as the 8501 on the right

### Planner Response

# Explanation

- Both ports 8501 and 8502 are already occupied by existing Streamlit processes from earlier runs. That’s why new runs fail with “Port … is already in use.”
- The two browser pages look identical because they’re the same app UI on different ports. That’s normal; the issue is just that the old servers are still running.

# Recommended Actions

- __Option A: free 8501/8502 (recommended)__  
  1) Find which PIDs are using the ports:
     - PowerShell:
       - Get PID for 8501: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8501 | Select LocalPort,OwningProcess,State`
       - Get PID for 8502: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8502 | Select LocalPort,OwningProcess,State`
       - Inspect process: `tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>"`
  2) Kill the processes:
     - `Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force`  
     - or `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`

  3) Relaunch:
     - Entry app: `uv run streamlit run streamlit_entry.py --server.port 8501`
     - Dashboard: `uv run streamlit run streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py --server.port 8502`

- __Option B: let Streamlit pick a free port automatically__  
  - `uv run streamlit run streamlit_entry.py --server.port 0`  
  - `uv run streamlit run streamlit_dashboard_sqlite.py --server.port 0`  
  This will choose any available port and open the browser.

- __Quick cleanup of all running streamlit processes (more aggressive)__  
  - List: `tasklist | findstr streamlit`  
  - Kill by name: `taskkill /IM streamlit.exe /F`  
  Use with care; it will stop all running Streamlit instances.

# Want me to run checks for you?

I can run the safe, read-only port/PID checks now and show you the results, then you can confirm which ones to kill. Should I go ahead?

### User Input

yes, please run the check and rerun

### Planner Response

I will first run read-only checks to identify which PIDs are using ports 8501 and 8502 and list running Streamlit processes. I won’t terminate anything yet. After I show you the PIDs, I’ll ask for confirmation to kill them and then rerun the apps.

### Planner Response

I will run simple PowerShell checks to identify which processes are listening on ports 8501 and 8502, then terminate only those PIDs, and finally relaunch both Streamlit apps on their respective ports.

### Planner Response

I will run a safe, read-only PowerShell command to list which processes are listening on ports 8501 and 8502, along with their process names and paths. Then I’ll propose kill commands for your approval and the relaunch commands.

### Planner Response

I found which processes are listening on your ports. I’ll show their details, then terminate those specific PIDs and relaunch both Streamlit apps. First, I’ll display the two processes using ports 8501 and 8502 so you can see them. Then I’ll stop them and start the apps again on the same ports.

*User accepted the command `tasklist /FI "PID eq 104644"; tasklist /FI "PID eq 97564"`*

### Planner Response

I will identify the processes by PID, terminate them to free the ports, then relaunch both Streamlit apps on 8501 and 8502. After starting the servers, I’ll open browser previews for you.

*User accepted the command `tasklist /FI "PID eq 104644" & tasklist /FI "PID eq 97564"`*

### Planner Response

I will identify the exact processes using ports 8501 and 8502 (by PID), then terminate them to free the ports, and finally relaunch both Streamlit apps. First, I’ll show details for each PID.

*User accepted the command `tasklist /FI "PID eq 104644"`*

### Planner Response

I will identify the second PID details for port 8502, then stop both PIDs to free the ports. After that, I’ll relaunch both Streamlit apps on 8501 and 8502 non-blocking, and open browser previews for each.
